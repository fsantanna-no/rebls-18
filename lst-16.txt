3rd International Workshop on Reactive and Event-Based Languages &
Systems

Held at SPLASH Conference http://2016.splashcon.org/
Amsterdam, Netherlands - November 1st, 2016

=====  Introduction  =====

Reactive programming and event-based programming are two closely
related programming styles that are becoming ever more important with
the advent of advanced HPC technology and the ever increasing
requirement for our applications to run on the web or on collaborating
mobile devices. A number of publications on middleware and language
design - so-called reactive and event-based languages and systems
(REBLS) - have already seen the light, but the field still raises
several questions. For example, the interaction with mainstream
language concepts is poorly understood, implementation technology is
in its infancy and modularity mechanisms are almost totally
lacking. Moreover, large applications are still to be developed and
patterns and tools for developing reactive applications is an area
that is vastly unexplored.

This workshop will gather researchers in reactive and event-based
languages and systems. The goal of the workshop is to exchange new
technical research results and to define better the field by coming up
with taxonomies and overviews of the existing work.


===== Contributions =====

Even though reactive programming and event-based programming are
receiving ever more attention, the field is far from mature. This
workshop will join forces and try to gather researchers working on the
foundational models, languages and implementation technologies. We
welcome all submissions on reactive programming, aspect- and
event-oriented systems, including but not limited to:

- Language design, implementation, runtime systems, program analysis,
  software metrics, patterns and benchmarks.

- Study of the paradigm: interaction of reactive and event-based
  programming with existing language features such as object-oriented
  programming, mutable state, concurrency.

- Advanced event systems, event quantification, event composition,
  aspect-oriented programming for reactive applications.

- Functional-reactive programming, self-adjusting computation and
  incremental computing.

- Applications, case studies that show the efficacy of reactive
  programming.

- Empirical studies that motivate further research in the field.

- Patterns and best-practices.

- Related fields, such as complex event processing, reactive data
  structures, view maintenance, constraint-based languages, and their
  integration with reactive programming. IDEs, Tools.

- Implementation technology, language runtimes, virtual machine support,
  compilers.

- Modularity and abstraction mechanisms in large systems.

- Formal models for reactive and event-based programming.

The format of the workshop is that of a mini-conference. Participants
can present their work in slots of 30mins with Q&A included. Because of
the declarative nature of reactive programs, it is often hard to understand
their semantics just by looking at the code. We therefore also encourage
authors to use their slots for presenting their work based on live demos.



=====  Submissions =====

REBLS encourages submissions of two types of papers:

- Research results: complete works that ill be published in the ACM
  digital library.

- In progress papers: papers that have the potential of triggering an
  interesting discussion at the workshop or present new ideas that
  require further systematic investigation. These papers will not be
  published in the ACM digital library.

Info about the format and the page limits can be found on the REBLS'16
website (http://2016.splashcon.org/track/rebls2016).



=====  Important dates =====

- Papers deadline:               August 1, 2016
- Papers notification:           September 5, 2016
- Workshop:                      November 1, 2016
